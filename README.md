## User Instructions

**NB: this application is not secure in any way. Any user can log in with your username.**

Before voting, you need to register an account.

After registering, you can add candidates and vote on them. The electoral system is [approval voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approval_voting) with the addition of an unrestricted veto right for everyone. Voting is not anonymous so that the veto cannot be abused.
